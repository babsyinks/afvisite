    description:`Average cost of mainstream film production today is $150 million. Hollywood 
    makes more than 200 films per year and looks for cheaper locations around the world.
    If Abuja Film Village can attract just one film per year, it can make at least $2 million
    a year.The AFVI Film Studio, which will provide state-of-the-art facilities for filmmaking, 
    will raise the quality of Nollywood films, and attract tourism revenue both locally and internationally.
    There is also the added benefit of potentially making millions of foreign exchange just servicing foreign films.
    Many nations are struggling to provide facilities to attract film production from Hollywood to their own soil 
    from all over the world. Currently, even Nollywood goes to Los Angeles and South Africa for their film making needs.
