        As a matter of both economic and social responsibility policy, the AFVI will not relocate the villages and villagers, thus saving the villagers the trauma of forceful relocation, and the Film Village
        initiative billions of Naira and possible years of litigation that can delay the Project. The existing villages in the area therefore offer wonderful opportunities for integrating them, their schools, places of worship, and other village facilities into our Village Concept. We will build or remodel their villages, and reorganize their farms into high-yielding plots, such that none will lose their direct means of livelihood as a result of the presence of the Film Village within their community. In addition we are partnering with cottage industries to set up their industries within the villages, as well as with environmentally friendly organic farmers [Agro Park], to further alleviate poverty there and improve their families’ lives. As configured, the Film Village is perhaps the only such entity that can incorporate Villages as an economic and poverty alleviating force, within its concrete jungle, this side of the 21st Century
